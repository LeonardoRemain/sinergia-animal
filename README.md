 I used my knowledge of web development to put into practice how I would do people's bios. 
 I tried to make the site as similar as possible to the real one, in order to give it a more visual effect. 
 
 
 Apparently the presentation of the team does not change, follows the photo and the name, with a small description. 
 But when hovering the mouse over the name, all information about that person is displayed on the screen, and we can even access their 
 linkedin by clicking with the right mouse button.
