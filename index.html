        <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
        <h2>BUILDING A WORLD WHERE NOBODY NEEDS TO BE HURT FOR FOOD PRODUCTION</H2>
        <p>Sinergia Animal is an international animal protection organization working in countries of the Global South to reduce the suffering of farmed animals and promote more compassionate food choices.</p>

        <h1>CREATED IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH,
            DEDICATED TO THE GLOBAL SOUTH</h1>
            <div class="local">
                <p>We work in the low- and middle-income countries of the Global South — in Southeast Asia and Latin America — to reduce the suffering of animals exploited by the food industry and reduce animal product consumption by promoting more compassionate and healthy diets.</p>
                <p>This is particularly challenging because animal product consumption is steadily increasing in the Global South, where animal agriculture has grown the most in the last 30 years. Intensive farming practices are becoming the predominant model in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.</p>

        <h1>WE HAVE BEEN RATED AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE NGOS IN THE WORLD</h1>
        <p>The year 2020 is the third in a row in which Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) recognized Sinergia Animal as one of the most effective animal protection NGOs in the world. It all started in 2018, with little more than a year of work. In 2019, we kept this recognition, and in 2021, we have once again been recommended. The Standout classification indicates that our work and campaigns can potentially affect large numbers of animals.</p>
